Problem 5

Here is code for linear search that uses the fact that a set of elements 
is sorted in increasing order:

def search(L, e):
    for i in range(len(L)):
        if L[i] == e:
            return True
        if L[i] > e:
            return False
    return False
 
Consider the following code, which is an alternative version of search.

def newsearch(L, e):
    size = len(L)
    for i in range(size):
        if L[size-i-1] == e:
            return True
        if L[i] < e:
            return False
    return False

Which of the following statements is correct? You may assume that each 
function is tested with a list L whose elements are sorted in increasing 
order; for simplicity, assume L is a list of positive integers.

Answer
search and newsearch return the same answers for lists L of length 0, or 1. - correct
